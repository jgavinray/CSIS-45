Gavilan College
CSIS 45 - C++ Programming 1
Professor: Dennie Van Tassel
Student: J. Gavin Ray

This entire Git is to include all coursework from the class.  It is being
placed on Github to allow porting of all software onto Windows/Mac/Linux
Platforms.  The Course is recommending Bloodshed Dev C++ IDE to do the work. 
While this IDE appears to be a full featured IDE, it isn't portable to Linux
or Mac.  Code::Blocks is going to be installed on all of my machines as it is
a tri-platform IDE (Windows/Mac/Linux), and will allow me to access and work
on my schoolwork from any location I need to.  As of this time I am also
planning to complete this work on a Pen Drive Linux Distrobution (Ubuntu 10.04)
to keep everything mobile.

Update 3/20/12

After going through about 30% of the class I couldn't stand using Code::Blocks
any more so I switched back to Xcode.  When I was in class and didn't have access
to that IDE I used Dev C++ in the class room as needed.
